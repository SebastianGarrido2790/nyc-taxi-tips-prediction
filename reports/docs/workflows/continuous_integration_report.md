# Phase 6.2: Deployment - Agentic Continuous Integration Report

## 1. Objective
The goal of Phase 6.2 was to implement a fully automated Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions. This guarantees that every change pushed to the `main` branch or proposed via a pull request is strictly verified against our "Agentic" Python standard before it can be merged or deployed.

## 2. CI/CD Architecture

We implemented two distinct, parallel workflows to separate testing logic from code quality enforcement. Both workflows leverage the official `astral-sh/setup-uv` action to provision environments instantly, benefiting from Rust-based dependency resolution and aggressive caching.

### 2.1 Agentic CI: Automated Testing Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
*   **Purpose:** Ensures that the "Brawn" (deterministic business logic) and Agentic Tool abstractions behave exactly as expected.
*   **Triggers:** `push` and `pull_request` to `main`.
*   **Job Identity:** `brawn-unit-tests`
*   **Agentic Orchestration Note:** We injected a dummy `GOOGLE_API_KEY` into the workflow environment. This prevents the Agentic modules and Pydantic validators from failing due to missing secrets during development-phase testing.
*   **Execution Steps:**
    1. Checks out the repository codebase.
    2. Installs `uv` with caching enabled.
    3. Sets up Python 3.11.
    4. Runs `uv sync --all-extras --frozen`.
    5. Executes the full `pytest` suite across the `tests/` directory.

### 2.2 Agentic Code Standards: Quality & Formatting Workflow (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`)
*   **Purpose:** Enforces strict adherence to PEP-8 and the Agentic standard, ensuring no "spaghetti code" enters the production branch.
*   **Triggers:** `push` and `pull_request` to `main`.
*   **Execution Steps:**
    1. Checks out the repository codebase.
    2. Installs `uv` with caching enabled.
    3. Sets up Python 3.11.
    4. Runs `uv sync --all-extras --frozen`.
    5. **Formatting:** Executes `uv run ruff format --check .` to verify layout consistency (spacing, quotes, line lengths).
    6. **Linting:** Executes `uv run ruff check .` to catch logical errors, unused imports, and bad practices.

## 3. The `uv` Advantage

In traditional pipelines, allocating time to install `pip` dependencies can take minutes per workflow run. By utilizing `uv` coupled with GitHub Actions caching, our environment provisioning time drops to mere seconds. 

The flag `--all-extras` was crucially added to ensure that the `dev` dependency group (containing `pytest` and `ruff`) is installed in the CI runner, while `--frozen` guarantees that the exact dependency tree defined in `uv.lock` is used, preventing "it works on my machine" bugs.

## 4. Verification & Hardening

During the implementation of these pipelines, the strict `ruff` linter immediately caught two latent issues in the codebase that had bypassed human review:
1.  An unused `pytest` import in `tests/unit/test_api.py`.
2.  An unused variable assignment (`trainer = ModelTrainer(...)`) in `tests/unit/test_model_trainer.py`.

These were proactively fixed and committed. The CI pipelines now serve as an automated gatekeeper, preventing any similar code quality degradation in the future.
